			     Booting Pintos
			     ==============

---- QUESTIONS ---- 
>> Put the screenshots of Pintos running in src/p0.
>> A1: Is there any particular issue that you would like us to know?

			     Debugging
			     =========

---- QUESTIONS: BIOS ---- 
>> B1: What is the first instruction that gets executed?
ljmp   $0x3630,$0xf000e05b

>> B2: At which physical address is this instruction located?
0xffff0

>> B3: Can you guess why the first instruction is like this?
The reset vector at 0xffff0 is just 16 bytes before the end of the 1MB real-mode
memory space. So the instruction executes a long jump to relocate execution to
a lower physical address within the BIOS ROM.

>> B4: What are the next three instructions?
cmpw   $0x28,%cs:(%esi)
jne    0xd241d0ad
xor    %edx,%edx

---- QUESTIONS: BOOTLOADER ---- 
>> B5: How does the bootloader read disk sectors? In particular, what BIOS interrupt
is used?
The bootloader reads disk sectors through the interrupt $0x13, with function code AH = 0x42.
This interrupt invokes the extended read function, which uses logical block addressing to
load sectors into memory from a hard disk.

>> B6: How does the bootloader decides whether it successfully finds the Pintos kernel?
The bootloader begins by reading sector 0 (The Master Boot Record) of each hard drive starting
at drive $0x80. It then checks for a valid MBR by verifying that bytes 510-511 contain the
signature $0xaa55. If valid, it scans the four 16-byte partition entries starting at byte
offset 446.
For each entry, the bootloader checks:
 - That it is not unused
 - That the partition type byte is 0x20, identifying a Pintos kernel partition
 - That the bootable flag is set to 0x80
If all checks pass, the loader jumps to load_kernel and loads the kernel from that partition
into memory.

>> B7: What happens when the bootloader could not find the Pintos kernel?
If the bootloader fails to find a Pintos kernel partition - meaning that it doesn't find a
partition with type 0x20 and bootable 0x80 - it reaches the no_boot_partition: label.
There, it calls puts to output the string "\rNot found\r" to the console, and then invokes
BIOS interrupt 0x18, which signals a boot failure and returns control to the BIOS.

>> B8: At what point and how exactly does the bootloader transfer control to the Pintos kernel?
The bootloader transfers control to the kernel right after it finishes loading all kernel sectors.
It reads the 32-bit entry point from offset 0x18 of the loaded ELF header, constructs a 16:16
segment:offset pointer at label start, and then performs a far jump (ljmp *start) to pass control
to the kernel. This jump marks the exact handoff from bootloader to kernel execution.


---- QUESTIONS: KERNEL ---- 
>> B9: At the entry of pintos_init(), what is the value of expression 
init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))] in hexadecimal format?

>> B10: When palloc_get_page() is called for the first time,

>> B10.1 what does the call stack look like?

>> B10.2 what is the return value in hexadecimal format?

>> B10.3 what is the value of expression init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))] in hexadecimal format?

>> B11: When palloc_get_page() is called for the third time,

>> B11.1 what does the call stack look like?

>> B11.2 what is the return value in hexadecimal format?

>> B11.3 what is the value of expression init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))] in hexadecimal format?

			     Kernel Monitor
			     ==============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

---- ALGORITHMS ----
>> C2: Explain how you read and write to the console for the kernel monitor.

>> C3: Any additional enhancement you implement?
